# The Nature of Code
_JavaScript Edition_

Daniel Shiffman has released a series of videos based on his book ["The Nature of Code"](http://natureofcode.com/); a step-by-step guide to implementing and utilising physics in code. He uses Processing as his language of choice but as a JavaScript guy, I thought I'd just play along in JavaScript. And this repo is the result.

In the REAMDEs I will embed the video lessons dealt with in the relevant section. And below is an introductory video to the course.
